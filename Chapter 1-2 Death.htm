  <p>Arthur, being the chickenheart that he is, swiftly leaps off the ground, avoiding the incoming bulldozer, which proptly destroys home.</p>
    
    <p>"Thank you for your prompt actions, Mr. Dent," said Prosser, "'till next time."</p>
    
    <p>Arthur stares at the remains of his home; bricks, curtain, bricks, an old Christmas gift his aunt gave him that he never used which remains remarkably unscathed, and some more bricks. He contemplates for several minutes. His home, his belongings, swept away in the blink of an eye. Arthur, a shell of the man he once was, wanders off into the distance.</p>
    
    <p>Then the Earth blows up.</p>
