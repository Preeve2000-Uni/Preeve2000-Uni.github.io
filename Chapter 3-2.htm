    <p>A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as anything.</p>
    
    <p>Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream.</p>
    
    <p>Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.</p>
    
    <p>Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.</p>
    
    <p>A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.</p>
    
    <p>At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt.</p>
    
    <p>To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.</p>
    
    <p>The President of the Galaxy had arrived.</p>
    
    <p>He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting.</p>
    
    <p>"Hi," he said.</p>
    
    <p>A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of Papier-mâché and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it.</p>
    
    <p>Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.</p>
    
    <p>"Hi," he said again.</p>
    
    <center><img src="A%20Tale%20of%20Three%20Trillians.jpg" alt=Which one is the real one??></center>
    
    <p>"Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Other reports say Trillian had light skin, frizzy blonde hair, ridiculously blue eyes, and strangely enough, an American accent, which made her look remarkably like Earth actress Sandra Dickinson. On the other hand, some say she looks remarkably like Earth actress Zooey Deschanel. Trillian's true appearance is quite the mystery.</p>
        
    <p>Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him.</p>
    
    <p>"Hi honey," he said to her.</p>
    
    <p>She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly - but by this time he was looking at something else.</p>
    
    <p>"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote.</p>
    
    <p>The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way.</p>
    
    <center><img src="The%20Heart%20of%20Gold.jpg" alt=The Heart of Gold width=30%></center>
    
    <p>Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named - The Heart of Gold. "Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't much else he could say.</p>
    
    <p>He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.</p>
    
    <p>"Wow."</p>
    
    <p>The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff.</p>
    
    <p>"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it."</p>
    
    <p>A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned.</p>
    
    <p>As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.</p>
    
    <p>Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.</p>
