 <p>"Hello Arthur" said Ford, standing above Arthur, who was still lying in dirty soil.</p>
    
 <p>"Ford! Hello, how are you?"</p>
    
    <p>"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?"</p>
    
    <p>"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house down if I don't, but other than that ... well, no not especially, why?"</p>
    
    <p>"Good, is there anywhere we can talk?" said Ford, failing to notice the sarcasm. He squatted down next to Arthur, saying "We've got to talk" with an unsettling sense of urgency.</p>
    
    <p>"Fine," said Arthur, "talk."</p>
    
    <p>"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the village."</p>
    
    <p>"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!"</p>
    
    <p>Ford glanced at him, puzzled. "Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked.</p>
    
    <p>"But I don't want him to!"</p>
    
    <p>"Ah."</p>
    
    <p>"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur.</p>
    
    <p>"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me - I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom."</p>
    
    <p>"But why?"</p>
    
    <p>"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink."</p>
    
    <p>Arthur felt his will begin to weaken, unexpectedly. "But what about my house ...?" he asked plaintively.</p>
    
    <p>Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him.</p>
    
    <p>"He wants to knock your house down?"</p>
    
    <p>"Yes, he wants to build..."</p>
    
    <p>"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?"</p>
    
    <p>"Yes, and..."</p>
    
    <p>I'm sure we can come to some arrangement." said Ford.</p>
    
    <p>And within the next 3 and a half minutes, Ford somehow managed to convince Prosser to take Arthur's place on the ground, while he and Arthur pop off for a quick drink, in a long, text heavy sequence that was cut for the sake of not having too many words on screen, which the "author" of this text version has already failed at. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now.</p>

    <p>"But can we trust him?" Arthur said, still understandably worried.</p>
    
    <p>"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford.</p>
    
    <p>"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?"</p>
    
    <p>"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink."</p>
