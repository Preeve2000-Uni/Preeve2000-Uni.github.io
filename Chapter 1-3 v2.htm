 <p>He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.</p>
    
 <p>Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you know."</p>
    
    <p>"Appropriate time?", hooted Arthur, "Appropriate time?! The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me."</p>
    
    <p>"But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months."</p>
    
    <p>Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything."</p>
    
    <p>"But the plans were on display..."</p>
    
    <p>"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."</p>
    
    <p>"That's the display department."</p>
    
    <p>"With a torch."</p>
    
    <p>"Ah, well the lights had probably gone."</p>
    
    <p>"So had the stairs."</p>
    
    <p>"But look, you found the notice didn't you?"</p>
    
    <p>"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'."</p>
    
    <p>A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house. Mr Prosser frowned at it.</p>
    
    <p>"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said.</p>
    
    <p>"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it."</p>
    
    <p>"You'll like the bypass."</p>
    
    <p>"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on and you know it."</p>
    
    <p>Mr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.</p>
    
    <p>"Mr Dent," he said.</p>
    
    <p>"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur.</p>
    
    <p>"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?"</p>
    
    <p>"How much?" said Arthur.</p>
    
    <p>"None at all," said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.</p>
    
    <p>By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.</p>
    
    <p>Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.</p>
    
    <p>Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.</p>
