    <center><h1>Just what is the hoopla about Vogon Poetry anyway?</h1></center>
  
    <p>Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.</p>
    
 <p>The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria.

Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve- book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain.</p>
