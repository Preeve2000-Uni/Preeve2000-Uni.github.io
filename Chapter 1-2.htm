 <p>Arthur blearily lifts himself out of bed, wanders blearily round his room, sees a bulldozer outside, slips on his slippers, throws on his bathrobe, brushes his teeth, adjusts the shaving mirror from looking out the window with an ever looming bulldozer visible to the bristles on his face, shaves, walks downstairs, reads the mail, and takes notice of a somewhat old looking letter, which contains information detailing plans to demolish his home in order to build a bypass. Interestingly, this letter was dated some 2 years ago. Eventually, the dots begin to connect, and realises that the bulldozer loitering outside of his home may commit a bigger case of vandalism than he previously thought.</p>
    
 <p>He rushes outside and places himself on the soil, in front of the advancing bulldozer, much to the annoyance of Mr. Prosser, who worked for the local council, and whose job it was to ensure the house was permenantely vacated from the premises, forcefully if need be.</p>
    
    <p>"Come off it, Mr. Dent,", Prosser said, "you can't win you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely."</p>
    
    <p>"I'm game," Arthur responds, "we'll see who rusts first."</p>
